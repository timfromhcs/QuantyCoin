"""End-to-end test for contrib/devtools/scan-legacy-dilithium-utxos.py.

The scan sizes what a P2MR-only activation would freeze on a chain with history
predating it (issue #111). Regtest activates P2MR-only at height 1, so this
pushes activation out of reach with -testactivationheight and mines the
pre-activation shapes the scan is meant to be pointed at.

Outputs are created from raw() descriptors rather than through the wallet. The
wallet's willingness to hand out legacy Dilithium destinations is itself
changing (issue #97), and this test is about whether the scan recognises the
scripts that are already sitting in blocks -- which does not depend on whether
the wallet would still produce them today.

Classification and spend bookkeeping are covered in isolation by
contrib/devtools/test-scan-legacy-dilithium-utxos.py. What this adds is that
walking real getblock output over RPC reaches the same answer.
