# QTY Code Review Guidelines

## Philosophy

Code review is the most important activity in QTY development. Every line of code that enters the repository must be thoroughly reviewed by qualified contributors. We prioritize security, correctness, and maintainability over development speed.

### Core Principles

- **Security First**: Post-quantum cryptography requires exceptional care
- **Quality Over Speed**: Thorough review prevents bugs and vulnerabilities
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Reviews are opportunities to learn and teach
- **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on technical merit, not personal style
- **Collaborative Process**: Work together to improve code quality

## ACK/NACK Taxonomy

### Concept ACK
**Meaning**: "I agree this problem should be solved"
**When to Use**: Early in PR lifecycle, before implementation review
**Example**: "Concept ACK - this memory leak needs to be fixed"

### Approach ACK  
**Meaning**: "I agree with the proposed solution approach"
**When to Use**: After reviewing design but before detailed code review
**Example**: "Approach ACK - using RAII here is the right solution"

### utACK (Untested ACK)
**Meaning**: "I reviewed the code and it looks correct, but didn't test it"
**When to Use**: When you've done thorough code review but no functional testing
**Requirements**: 
- Read and understood all changed code
- Verified logic correctness
- Checked for obvious bugs or issues
**Example**: "utACK abc123d - code looks correct, good test coverage"

### Tested ACK
**Meaning**: "I reviewed the code AND built and tested the changes"
**When to Use**: After both code review and functional validation
**Requirements**:
- All requirements of utACK
- Built the code locally
- Ran relevant test suites
- Tested new functionality manually (if applicable)
**Example**: "Tested ACK def456g - built and tested on Ubuntu 22.04, all tests pass"

### NACK
**Meaning**: "I object to this change"
**When to Use**: When you believe the change should not be merged
**Requirements**:
- Provide specific technical reasoning
- Suggest alternatives when possible
- Be constructive and professional
**Example**: "NACK - this approach introduces a race condition in line 45, suggest using atomic operations instead"

### Stale Review Handling
- Reviews become stale after significant changes
- Reviewers should re-review after force pushes
- Maintainers may request fresh reviews for old PRs

## Review Process

### Initial Review

1. **Concept Review**

   - Provide Approach ACK or suggest improvements

### Detailed Code Review

3. **Line-by-Line Review**
   - Read every changed line carefully

## Common Review Patterns

### Security Review Patterns

**Input Validation**:
```cpp
// Good: Comprehensive validation
if (input.size() > MAX_SIZE || input.empty()) {
    return error("Invalid input size");
}

// Bad: Missing validation
process_input(input);  // No size check
```

**Memory Safety**:
```cpp
// Good: RAII and bounds checking
std::vector<uint8_t> buffer(size);
if (offset + length > buffer.size()) {
    return false;
}

// Bad: Manual memory management
uint8_t* buffer = new uint8_t[size];  // Potential leak
```

### Performance Review Patterns

**Efficient Algorithms**:
```cpp
// Good: O(log n) lookup
auto it = sorted_map.find(key);

// Bad: O(n) search
for (const auto& item : large_vector) {
    if (item.key == key) break;
}
```

**Memory Efficiency**:
```cpp
// Good: Reserve capacity
std::vector<Item> items;
items.reserve(expected_size);

// Bad: Repeated allocations
std::vector<Item> items;  // Will reallocate multiple times
```

## Review Tools and Automation

- Network performance testing

## Handling Disagreements

3. **Test Alternatives**: Implement and compare different approaches
4. **Build Consensus**: Work toward agreement through technical merit
5. **Escalate if Needed**: Maintainers make final decisions
