//! Tests for the bootstrap seed configuration.
//!
//! A node with an empty peers.dat has exactly two ways to find its first peer:
//! DNS seeds, and the hardcoded fixed seeds that exist to cover the case where
//! DNS seeding fails. Neither is exercised by any other test, and a mistake in
//! either is invisible until a fresh node cannot join the network -- which is
//! the situation described in issue #114.
