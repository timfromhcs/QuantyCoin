## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following QTY versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Life |
| ------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| 1.1.x   | ✅ Current         | TBD         |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Reporting Process

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Use either private channel, preferring the first:

1. **GitHub private vulnerability reporting** — "Report a vulnerability" under
   the repository's Security tab. Private, authenticated, no key management.
2. **Email** — **security@qty.tech**, unencrypted.

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if any)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### Response Timeline

We are pretty responsive, so we will try to meet these timelines with regards to responding to security reports.

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Development**: 30-90 days depending on complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to upgrade

### Severity Categories

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Consensus failures leading to chain splits
- Private key extraction
- **Response**: Immediate embargo, emergency release

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Denial of service attacks
- Transaction malleability
- Wallet fund loss
- **Response**: 30-day embargo, coordinated release

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Information disclosure
- Minor protocol violations
- Performance degradation
- **Response**: 60-day embargo, next scheduled release

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Minor bugs with limited impact
- **Response**: Public issue after fix is ready

## Encrypted reporting

QTY Core does not publish PGP keys. **Use GitHub private vulnerability
reporting** when a report must stay confidential — it is private end to end,
requires no key exchange, and carries the whole thread through to advisory
publication. Email to security@qty.tech is unencrypted and is the fallback.

## Disclosure Timeline

### Standard Process

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial response and triage
3. **Day 7**: Severity assessment and embargo timeline set
4. **Day 30-90**: Fix development and testing
5. **Day 90-120**: Coordinated disclosure and release
6. **Day 120+**: Public advisory publication

### Emergency Process (Critical Vulnerabilities)

1. **Hour 0**: Report received
2. **Hour 6**: Emergency team assembled
3. **Day 1**: Fix development begins
4. **Day 3-7**: Emergency release prepared
5. **Day 7**: Public release and advisory

## Advisory Publication

### Advisory Format

```markdown
# QTY Security Advisory [YEAR]-[NUMBER]

- YYYY-MM-DD: Public disclosure
```

### Publication Channels

- GitHub Security Advisories
- QTY website security page
- Mailing list notifications
- Telegram announcements (link to GitHub)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **Verify Downloads**: Always check SHA256SUMS and GPG signatures
- **Keep Updated**: Install security updates promptly
- **Secure Setup**: Use proper firewall and access controls
- **Backup Wallets**: Maintain secure, encrypted backups

### For Developers

- **Code Review**: All security-sensitive code requires expert review
- **Testing**: Include negative test cases and edge conditions
- **Dependencies**: Keep third-party libraries updated
- **Secrets**: Never commit private keys or sensitive configuration

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

### For Security Researchers

- **Good Faith**: Research conducted in good faith with intent to improve security
- **Scope**: Focus on QTY Core software, not infrastructure attacks
- **No Harm**: Do not access, modify, or delete user data
- **Disclosure**: Work with us on responsible timeline before public disclosure

### Recognition

- Security researchers will be credited in advisories (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Significant contributions may be eligible for bounty rewards
- Hall of fame recognition on QTY website

## Emergency Contacts

For urgent security matters requiring immediate attention, email
**security@qty.tech** and put `URGENT` in the subject line. The address is
monitored by more than one person, so it does not depend on any individual
being available.

## Security Audit History

| Date | Scope | Auditor | Report |
|------|-------|---------|---------|
| TBD  | Full codebase | TBD | TBD |
