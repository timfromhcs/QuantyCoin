"""Regression test for CVE-2024-52911 (use-after-free in the script interpreter).

ConnectBlock dispatches script checks to background threads as CScriptCheck
functors. Each holds a *pointer* into a PrecomputedTransactionData, so that data
must outlive the check queue.

Local objects are destroyed in reverse order of construction, so the queue
control has to be constructed *after* the data it points at. When the order is
inverted, an early return between queueing the checks and the explicit
control.Wait() frees the precomputed data while it is still needed:
~CCheckQueueControl calls Wait(), and Wait() runs the outstanding checks.

Three conditions all have to hold for the dangling pointer to actually be
dereferenced, which is why this block is shaped so specifically.

1.  The queue must be deep at the instant of the return. One transaction with
    many inputs queues a large batch in a single control.Add(), and the *next*
    transaction is rejected, so the main thread does almost no work in between.
    Padding the block with ordinary transactions instead lets the worker drain
    the queue while the main thread grinds through the rest of the loop.

2.  The inputs must use a segwit sighash. BIP143 reads the cached midstate out
    of PrecomputedTransactionData; legacy P2PK and P2PKH sighashes never touch
    it, so a block full of those leaves the pointer dangling but unread and
    nothing is observable.

3.  The transaction must not be in the mempool. ConnectBlock consults the
    script execution cache first, and a hit means no checks are queued at all --
    hence signing here rather than broadcasting.

Under a normal build the freed read is silent and this only confirms the node
rejects the block and stays up. Observing the defect itself needs an
AddressSanitizer build:

    ./configure --with-sanitizers=address && make
    ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0 test/functional/feature_cve_2024_52911.py

Against the unfixed tree that reports a heap-use-after-free in SignatureHash(),
read by a b-scriptch worker and freed by the thread running ConnectBlock.
